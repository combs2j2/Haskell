# Haskell

My primary academic background being mathematics, I have found Haskell to be an exceedingly useful tool for finding solutions to problems in a number of fields, especially in Number Theory.

primes.hs implements a number of functions involving prime numbers and residues. isPrime :: Int -> Bool determines if a positive integer is prime, specifically by determining if the given input has any primes factors below its square root; if a number has no prime factors below its square root, then the number has no prime factors at all, thus the number is prime. numPrimesUpTo :: Int -> Int determines the number of prime numbers between 0 and the given input. This is calculated recursively, with the base case being n = 2, which evaluates to 1 since 2 is prime, but 0 and 1 are not. densityOfPrimes :: Int -> Rational determines the proportion of numbers from 1 up to the given input that are prime. The function calls numPrimesUpTo n, then divides this result by n. Both numPrimesUpTo n and n are converted to Rationals, then these two rationals are divided to produce the desired (fraction) output. relativelyPrime :: Int -> Int -> Bool determines if the two integer inputs are relatively prime. That is, if the inputs have a gcd (greatest common divisor) of 1. eulerPhi :: Int -> Int calculates the number of integers between 1 and the input that are relatively prime to the input. eulerPhi n generates a list of integers from 1 to n that are relatively prime to n and calculates the length of the list, and therefore the output of the function.
